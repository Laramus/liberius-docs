                    Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed. If you are developing on macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed within minutes via Laravel Herd. In addition, we recommend installing Node and NPM. <br><br>

                    After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Laravel project via the Composer create-project command:
                </p>

                <div class="my-4 p-4 rounded-md bg-[#242424] text-gray-300">
                    composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
                </div>

                <p class="font-thin text-gray-500 w-[700px]">
                    Or, you may create new Laravel projects by globally installing the Laravel installer via Composer. Or, if you installed PHP and Composer via Laravel Herd, the Laravel installer is already available to you:
                </p>

                
                <div class="my-4 p-4 rounded-md bg-[#242424] text-gray-300">
                    composer global require laravel/installer
                    <br><br>
